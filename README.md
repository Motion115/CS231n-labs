# CS231n Labs

This is a repository for CS231n's 3 assignments. Due to limits of time and the nature of my purpose in learning this course, it is more or less a smorgasbord of all the solutions from the internet rather than a carefully coded and drafted homework.

The major references are:
- https://github.com/lightaime/cs231n
- https://github.com/Halfish/cs231n
- https://cs231n.github.io/

Further work will be completed in the future:
- Assignment 2 & 3
- Notes on codes completed, and alternate coding options.
